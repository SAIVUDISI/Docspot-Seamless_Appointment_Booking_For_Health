# Docspot-Seamless_Appointment_Booking_For_Health

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
MongoDB ‚Äì NoSQL database to store users (doctors/patients), appointments, tokens.

Express.js ‚Äì Server-side framework in Node.js for building REST APIs (register, book appointment, token handling).

Node.js ‚Äì Backend runtime executing Express and connecting to MongoDB.

React.js ‚Äì Frontend SPA fetching data from API, handling authentication, booking UI.

Likely uses JWT for auth and Axios for API calls.

Optionally integrates Google Maps API (or similar) for location-based doctor search.

‚öô How It Runs
Backend Setup

Define routes: /api/auth, /api/doctors, /api/appointments, etc.

Set up token-based appointment logic (e.g. incrementing token counter when a patient books).

Database Layer

Schemas for users (role, credentials) and appointments (doctorId, patientId, slot, token number).

Frontend Setup

React components: login/signup, search doctors, appointment calendar, token confirmation, doctor dashboard to view bookings.

Workflow

Patients sign up/login ‚Üí search available doctors ‚Üí choose slot ‚Üí receive booked token number.

Doctors login ‚Üí manage availability and view current token queue.

‚úÖ Requirements
Node.js & npm installed.

MongoDB instance (local or Atlas).

Basic env variables: MongoDB URI, JWT secret, API keys (if using maps).

Postman or front-end to test API endpoints.

üéØ Skills Learned
Building RESTful APIs with CRUD operations.

Implementing user auth using JWT (sign-up, login, protected routes).

Managing React state, components, and asynchronous API calls.

Designing relational workflows: doctors vs patients with roles and permissions.

Managing token-based appointment queues per time slot.

Environmental config (.env), modular folder structure, and full-stack deployment basics.
